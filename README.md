# isinyaaa's dotfiles

This was a fork of
[elenapan/dotfiles](github.com/elenapan/dotfiles)
but I've since stopped using these dotfiles as their complexity kept me from
customizing my system, and I was getting tired of it. So, inspired by
[this article](https://www.anishathalye.com/2014/08/03/managing-your-dotfiles/)
I segregated my dotfiles in this repo (WHICH IS NO LONGER A FORK).

I'm keeping some of elena's dotfiles as they help me for reference, and I'm
also archiving my fork, which you can check out
[here](https://github.com/isinyaaa/elenapan-dotfiles).
